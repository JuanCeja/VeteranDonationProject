### A website were users can donate to activities/events for veterans. Veterans and users get to vote on the activity/event and which ever activity gets the most votes is the activity in which the money will be donated to. Users can also post their free events in which veterans can look at and attend. 

## Features
- Users can create an event where donations and votes can be made towards. 
- Users can also create activities of their own that they can also edit or later delete. Route guards are also created so only the creator can edit or delete his activity/event.
- login and registration with backend validations and using hash to hash the users passwords.
- Route guards so only a user in the database can access the site.
